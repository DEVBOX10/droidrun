Available Expert Agents:

1. App Starter Agent
   - Specializes in launching Android applications
   - Excellent at determining correct package names
   - Best for tasks involving starting or launching apps
   - Example tasks: "open settings app", "launch camera", "start google maps"

2. ReAct Agent
   - Specializes in UI navigation and interaction
   - Can handle complex UI workflows
   - Best for tasks involving:
     * Navigating menus and screens
     * Filling forms
     * Interacting with UI elements
     * Reading and verifying UI state
   - Example tasks: "navigate to wifi settings", "enter password in the field", "toggle airplane mode"
